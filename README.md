# 💼 Employee Salary Prediction using Multiple Regression Models

This project demonstrates **salary prediction based on position level** using multiple **machine learning regression models**.  
It compares different algorithms, visualizes their predictions, and saves trained models for future use.

The goal is to understand how different regressors behave on the same dataset and how their predictions vary.
